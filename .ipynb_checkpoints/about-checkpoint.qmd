We are Kathleen and Shreya. 
Our collaboration goes beyond this project; we have been roommates since semester 1 and have wanted to work on an interesting project together. Based on the incessant conversations in the living room until 2am, we really wanted to study and visualize an impending problem and test whether it is affected by climate change.
