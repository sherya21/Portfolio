Here are some of many samples from various parts of my life from editing, book design to graphics and data visualization!

I designed the coverpage and diagrams, directed the graphic design team and printed at the publisher,  India's first climate action plan, The <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #95C6B6;">Mumbai Climate Action Plan</span>. I single-handedly rebranded for UPenn's Department of Philosophy project, <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #95C6B6;">Philosophy4Young</span> their logo, website and children's books. I helped a young entreprenuer (my sister) publish her first recipe book, <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #95C6B6;">Granny's Chulha</span>, by designing, branding and illustrating the book. In another life, for a whole year I worked on publishing a thesis volume and project on <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #95C6B6;">'Decoding Response in the City'</span>.
