## Introduction

USVI is under immense climate stress. Following the hurricanes in 2017 and the pandemic in 2020, the continued climate change crisis, it is clear that we need to help the islands become more resilient and healthy. We believe that the way to make this more efficient and faster would be by using data to help plan and manage resources.
Through this project we want to answer how data analytics can help St. Thomas with climate and environmental planning? What does a systemic and localized data framework look like for St.Thomas? How can local agencies leverage data to better understand and respond to climate change and help vulnerable communities?

To manage this it needs a robust plan and a network of real-time updates to be prepared and resilient. Currently it has over 600+ datasets that contain information around demographics and climatic stressors but these are stored across the internet in various sources. DPNR, the planning agency of the island aims to digitize some of its processes to save time and make them more efficient.
