A designer, thinker, story-teller, researcher and planner, I bring together my eclectic skills wherever I go. My interest lies at the intersection of climate change planning and urban technology. Currently, I work as an Analyst at [Climate Policy Initiative](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/) working on [CLIC](https://climateshotinvestor.org/) and climate adaptation finance projects.


Recently, I completed a Master of City Planning at the [Weitzman School of Design](https://www.design.upenn.edu/graduate-admissions/people/shreya-bansal), University of Pennsylvania. There I worked with Dr. Sanya Carley at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy on energy justice research. I also cofounded the [Penn Food Club](https://www.instagram.com/pennfoodclub/) and the [Urban Technologies Club](https://www.instagram.com/urbantechclub_penn/). Previously, I worked as a Program Associate with the [World Resources Institute](https://wri-india.org/) in Mumbai. I also hold a bachelor's degree in architecture.


 I love all things <span style="color: #BD90CB;"> data visualization, book design, graphic design and research!</span>
