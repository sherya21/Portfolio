I am second year Master of City Planning candidate at the [Weitzman School of Design](https://www.design.upenn.edu/graduate-admissions/people/shreya-bansal), University of Pennsylvania. A designer, thinker, story-teller, researcher and planner, I bring together my eclectic skills wherever I go. My research lies at the intersection of climate change planning and civic technology. 

Currently, I am working with Dr. Sanya Carley at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at Penn on energy justice research. At Penn, I cofounded the [Penn Food Club](https://www.instagram.com/pennfoodclub/) and the [Urban Technologies Club](https://www.instagram.com/urbantechclub_penn/). Last summer, I completed an internship with the [Climate Policy Initiative](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/), working on multilateral bank reform for urban climate finance. Previously, I worked as a Program Associate with the [World Resources Institute](https://wri-india.org/) in Mumbai. I also hold a bachelor's degree in architecture.
