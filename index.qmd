<span style="font-size: 25px;"> Born in the chaos of a growing metropolitian of India, I rejoiced the culture, food and people I encountered but the same city was home to an exploding population, extreme pollution and surge of construction. I took to architecture to try to tackle these issues but soon realized that change had to be made at a larger but solvable scale:the city. Here I am: a designer, planner, story-teller, and climate advocate. I hope to bring a unique blend of perspective into every project I undertake. </span>
