Wildfires, a phenomenon where an uncontrolled fire that burns in the wildland vegetation, has been a growing concern in the US in recent years, largely related to climate change fears.

As wildfires become increasingly common, it is crucial to equip policy-makers and first responders with tools to help better predict areas that are most likely to set ablaze across the State.
